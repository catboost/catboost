/*! \p pointer stores a pointer to an object allocated in memory. Like \p device_ptr, this
 *  type ensures type safety when dispatching standard algorithms on ranges resident in memory.
 *
 *  \p pointer generalizes \p device_ptr by relaxing the backend system associated with the \p pointer.
 *  Instead of the backend system specified by \p THRUST_DEFAULT_DEVICE_BACKEND, \p pointer's
 *  system is given by its second template parameter, \p Tag. For the purpose of Thrust dispatch,
 *  <tt>device_ptr<Element></tt> and <tt>pointer<Element,device_system_tag></tt> are considered equivalent.
 *
 *  The raw pointer encapsulated by a \p pointer may be obtained through its <tt>get</tt> member function
 *  or the \p raw_pointer_cast free function.
 *
 *  \tparam Element specifies the type of the pointed-to object.
 *
 *  \tparam Tag specifies the system with which this \p pointer is associated. This may be any Thrust
 *          backend system, or a user-defined tag.
 *
 *  \tparam Reference allows the client to specify the reference type returned upon derereference.
 *          By default, this type is <tt>reference<Element,pointer></tt>.
 *
 *  \tparam Derived allows the client to specify the name of the derived type when \p pointer is used as
 *          a base class. This is useful to ensure that arithmetic on values of the derived type return
 *          values of the derived type as a result. By default, this type is <tt>pointer<Element,Tag,Reference></tt>.
 *
 *  \note \p pointer is not a smart pointer; it is the client's responsibility to deallocate memory
 *        pointer to by \p pointer.
