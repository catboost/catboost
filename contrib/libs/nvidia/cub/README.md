<h3>About CUB</h3>

CUB provides state-of-the-art, reusable software components for every layer
of the CUDA programming model:
- [<b><em>Device-wide primitives</em></b>](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/group___device_module.html)
  - Sort, prefix scan, reduction, histogram, etc.
  - Compatible with CUDA dynamic parallelism
- [<b><em>Block-wide "collective" primitives</em></b>](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/group___block_module.html)
  - I/O, sort, prefix scan, reduction, histogram, etc.
  - Compatible with arbitrary thread block sizes and types
- [<b><em>Warp-wide "collective" primitives</em></b>](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/group___warp_module.html)
  - Warp-wide prefix scan, reduction, etc.
  - Safe and architecture-specific
- [<b><em>Thread and resource utilities</em></b>](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/group___util_io.html)
  - PTX intrinsics, device reflection, texture-caching iterators, caching memory allocators, etc.

![Orientation of collective primitives within the CUDA software stack](http://nvlabs.github.io/cub/cub_overview.png)

CUB is included in the NVIDIA HPC SDK and the CUDA Toolkit.

We recommend the [CUB Project Website](http://nvlabs.github.io/cub) for further information and examples.

<h3>A Simple Example</h3>

```C++
#include <cub/cub.cuh>

// Block-sorting CUDA kernel
__global__ void BlockSortKernel(int *d_in, int *d_out)
{
     using namespace cub;

     // Specialize BlockRadixSort, BlockLoad, and BlockStore for 128 threads
     // owning 16 integer items each
     typedef BlockRadixSort<int, 128, 16>                     BlockRadixSort;
     typedef BlockLoad<int, 128, 16, BLOCK_LOAD_TRANSPOSE>   BlockLoad;
     typedef BlockStore<int, 128, 16, BLOCK_STORE_TRANSPOSE> BlockStore;

     // Allocate shared memory
     __shared__ union {
         typename BlockRadixSort::TempStorage  sort;
         typename BlockLoad::TempStorage       load;
         typename BlockStore::TempStorage      store;
     } temp_storage;

     int block_offset = blockIdx.x * (128 * 16);	  // OffsetT for this block's ment

     // Obtain a segment of 2048 consecutive keys that are blocked across threads
     int thread_keys[16];
     BlockLoad(temp_storage.load).Load(d_in + block_offset, thread_keys);
     __syncthreads();

     // Collectively sort the keys
     BlockRadixSort(temp_storage.sort).Sort(thread_keys);
     __syncthreads();

     // Store the sorted segment
     BlockStore(temp_storage.store).Store(d_out + block_offset, thread_keys);
}
```

Each thread block uses `cub::BlockRadixSort` to collectively sort
its own input segment.  The class is specialized by the
data type being sorted, by the number of threads per block, by the number of
keys per thread, and implicitly by the targeted compilation architecture.

The `cub::BlockLoad` and `cub::BlockStore` classes are similarly specialized.
Furthermore, to provide coalesced accesses to device memory, these primitives are
configured to access memory using a striped access pattern (where consecutive threads
simultaneously access consecutive items) and then <em>transpose</em> the keys into
a [<em>blocked arrangement</em>](index.html#sec4sec3) of elements across threads.

Once specialized, these classes expose opaque `TempStorage` member types.
The thread block uses these storage types to statically allocate the union of
shared memory needed by the thread block.  (Alternatively these storage types
could be aliased to global memory allocations).

<h3>Development Process</h3>

CUB and Thrust depend on each other. It is recommended to clone Thrust
and build CUB as a component of Thrust.

CUB uses the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/) to build unit tests,
examples, and header tests. To build CUB as a developer, the following
recipe should be followed:

```
# Clone Thrust and CUB from Github. CUB is located in Thrust's
# `dependencies/cub` submodule.
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVIDIA/thrust.git
cd thrust

# Create build directory:
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure -- use one of the following:
cmake -DTHRUST_INCLUDE_CUB_CMAKE=ON ..   # Command line interface.
ccmake -DTHRUST_INCLUDE_CUB_CMAKE=ON ..  # ncurses GUI (Linux only)
cmake-gui  # Graphical UI, set source/build directories and options in the app

# Build:
cmake --build . -j <num jobs>   # invokes make (or ninja, etc)

# Run tests and examples:
ctest
```

By default, the C++14 standard is targeted, but this can be changed in CMake.
More information on configuring your CUB build and creating a pull request is
found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
