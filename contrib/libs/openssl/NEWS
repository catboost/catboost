      o EGD support
      o BIGNUM library bug fixes
      o Faster DSA parameter generation
      o Enhanced support for Alpha Linux
      o Experimental MacOS support

  Major changes between OpenSSL 0.9.3 and OpenSSL 0.9.4 [9 Aug 1999]:

      o Transparent support for PKCS#8 format private keys: these are used
        by several software packages and are more secure than the standard
        form
      o PKCS#5 v2.0 implementation
      o Password callbacks have a new void * argument for application data
      o Avoid various memory leaks
      o New pipe-like BIO that allows using the SSL library when actual I/O
        must be handled by the application (BIO pair)

  Major changes between OpenSSL 0.9.2b and OpenSSL 0.9.3 [24 May 1999]:
      o Lots of enhancements and cleanups to the Configuration mechanism
      o RSA OEAP related fixes
      o Added `openssl ca -revoke' option for revoking a certificate
      o Source cleanups: const correctness, type-safe stacks and ASN.1 SETs
      o Source tree cleanups: removed lots of obsolete files
      o Thawte SXNet, certificate policies and CRL distribution points
        extension support
      o Preliminary (experimental) S/MIME support
      o Support for ASN.1 UTF8String and VisibleString
      o Full integration of PKCS#12 code
      o Sparc assembler bignum implementation, optimized hash functions
      o Option to disable selected ciphers

  Major changes between OpenSSL 0.9.1c and OpenSSL 0.9.2b [22 Mar 1999]:
      o Fixed a security hole related to session resumption
      o Fixed RSA encryption routines for the p < q case
      o "ALL" in cipher lists now means "everything except NULL ciphers"
      o Support for Triple-DES CBCM cipher
      o Support of Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) for RSA
      o First support for new TLSv1 ciphers
      o Added a few new BIOs (syslog BIO, reliable BIO)
      o Extended support for DSA certificate/keys.
      o Extended support for Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)
      o Initial support for X.509v3 extensions
      o Extended support for compression inside the SSL record layer
      o Overhauled Win32 builds
      o Cleanups and fixes to the Big Number (BN) library
      o Support for ASN.1 GeneralizedTime
      o Splitted ASN.1 SETs from SEQUENCEs
      o ASN1 and PEM support for Netscape Certificate Sequences
      o Overhauled Perl interface
      o Lots of source tree cleanups.
      o Lots of memory leak fixes.
      o Lots of bug fixes.

      o Added BIO proxy and filtering functionality
      o Extended Big Number (BN) library
      o Added RIPE MD160 message digest
      o Added support for RC2/64bit cipher
      o Extended ASN.1 parser routines
      o Adjustments of the source tree for CVS
