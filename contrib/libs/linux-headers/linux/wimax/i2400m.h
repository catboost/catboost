 *  - Initial implementation
 *
 *
 * This header defines the data structures and constants used to
 * communicate with the device.
 *
 * BOOTMODE/BOOTROM/FIRMWARE UPLOAD PROTOCOL
 *
 * The firmware upload protocol is quite simple and only requires a
 * handful of commands. See drivers/net/wimax/i2400m/fw.c for more
 * details.
 *
 * The BCF data structure is for the firmware file header.
 *
 *
 * THE DATA / CONTROL PROTOCOL
 *
 * This is the normal protocol spoken with the device once the
 * firmware is uploaded. It transports data payloads and control
 * messages back and forth.
 *
 * It consists 'messages' that pack one or more payloads each. The
 * format is described in detail in drivers/net/wimax/i2400m/rx.c and
 * tx.c.
 *
 *
 * THE L3L4 PROTOCOL
 *
 * The term L3L4 refers to Layer 3 (the device), Layer 4 (the
 * driver/host software).
 *
 * This is the control protocol used by the host to control the i2400m
 * device (scan, connect, disconnect...). This is sent to / received
 * as control frames. These frames consist of a header and zero or
 * more TLVs with information. We call each control frame a "message".
 *
 * Each message is composed of:
 *
 * HEADER
 * [TLV0 + PAYLOAD0]
 * [TLV1 + PAYLOAD1]
 * [...]
 * [TLVN + PAYLOADN]
 *
 * The HEADER is defined by 'struct i2400m_l3l4_hdr'. The payloads are
 * defined by a TLV structure (Type Length Value) which is a 'header'
 * (struct i2400m_tlv_hdr) and then the payload.
 *
 * All integers are represented as Little Endian.
 *
 * - REQUESTS AND EVENTS
 *
 * The requests can be clasified as follows:
 *
 *   COMMAND:  implies a request from the host to the device requesting
 *             an action being performed. The device will reply with a
 *             message (with the same type as the command), status and
 *             no (TLV) payload. Execution of a command might cause
 *             events (of different type) to be sent later on as
 *             device's state changes.
 *
 *   GET/SET:  similar to COMMAND, but will not cause other
 *             EVENTs. The reply, in the case of GET, will contain
 *             TLVs with the requested information.
 *
 *   EVENT:    asynchronous messages sent from the device, maybe as a
 *             consequence of previous COMMANDs but disassociated from
 *             them.
 *
 * Only one request might be pending at the same time (ie: don't
 * parallelize nor post another GET request before the previous
 * COMMAND has been acknowledged with it's corresponding reply by the
 * device).
 *
 * The different requests and their formats are described below:
 *
 *  I2400M_MT_*   Message types
 *  I2400M_MS_*   Message status (for replies, events)
 *  i2400m_tlv_*  TLVs
 *
 * data types are named 'struct i2400m_msg_OPNAME', OPNAME matching the
 * operation.
