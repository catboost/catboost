oneTBB is a flexible C++ library that simplifies the work of adding parallelism
to complex applications, even if you are not a threading expert.  

The library lets you easily write parallel programs that take full advantage of the multi-core performance. Such programs are portable, 
composable and have a future-proof scalability. oneTBB provides you with functions, interfaces, and classes to parallelize and scale the code.
All you have to do is to use the templates. 

The library differs from typical threading packages in the following ways:
* oneTBB enables you to specify logical parallelism instead of threads.
* oneTBB targets threading for performance.
* oneTBB is compatible with other threading packages.
* oneTBB emphasizes scalable, data parallel programming.
* oneTBB relies on generic programming.


Refer to oneTBB [examples](examples) and [samples](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/Libraries/oneTBB) to see how you can use the library.

oneTBB is a part of the [UXL Foundation](http://www.uxlfoundation.org) and is an implementation of [oneAPI specification](https://oneapi.io).

> **_NOTE:_** Threading Building Blocks (TBB) is now called oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) to highlight that the tool is a part of the oneAPI ecosystem.
