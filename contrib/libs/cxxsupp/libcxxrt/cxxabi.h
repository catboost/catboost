 * Structure used as a header on thrown exceptions.  This is the same layout as
 * defined by the Itanium ABI spec, so should be interoperable with any other
 * implementation of this spec, such as GNU libsupc++.
 *
 * This structure is allocated when an exception is thrown.  Unwinding happens
 * in two phases, the first looks for a handler and the second installs the
 * context.  This structure stores a cache of the handler location between
 * phase 1 and phase 2.  Unfortunately, cleanup information is not cached, so
 * must be looked up in both phases.  This happens for two reasons.  The first
 * is that we don't know how many frames containing cleanups there will be, and
 * we should avoid dynamic allocation during unwinding (the exception may be
 * reporting that we've run out of memory).  The second is that finding
 * cleanups is much cheaper than finding handlers, because we don't have to
 * look at the type table at all.
 *
 * Note: Several fields of this structure have not-very-informative names.
 * These are taken from the ABI spec and have not been changed to make it
 * easier for people referring to to the spec while reading this code.
