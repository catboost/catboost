Dear Qhull User

We would like to find out how you are using our software.  Think of
Qhull as a new kind of shareware: you share your science and successes 
with us, and we share our software and support with you. 

If you use Qhull, please send us a note telling
us what you are doing with it.

We need to know:

  (1) What you are working on - an abstract of your work would be
      fine.

  (2) How Qhull has helped you, for example, by increasing your 
      productivity or allowing you to do things you could not do
      before.  If Qhull had a direct bearing on your work, please 
      tell us about this.

We encourage you to cite Qhull in your publications.  

To cite Qhull, please use
