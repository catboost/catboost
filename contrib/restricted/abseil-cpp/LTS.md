# Long Term Support (LTS) Branches

This repository contains periodic snapshots of the Abseil codebase that are
Long Term Support (LTS) branches. An LTS branch allows you to use a known
version of Abseil without interfering with other projects which may also, in
turn, use Abseil. (For more information about our releases, see the
[Abseil Release Management](https://abseil.io/about/releases) guide.)
