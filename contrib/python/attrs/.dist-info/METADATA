.. teaser-begin

``attrs`` is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka `dunder <https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html>`_ methods).

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.

.. teaser-end

For that, it gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

.. -code-begin-

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import attr

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class SomeClass(object):
   ...     a_number = attr.ib(default=42)
   ...     list_of_numbers = attr.ib(factory=list)
   ...
   ...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
   ...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


   >>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   >>> sc
   SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

   >>> sc.hard_math(3)
   19
   >>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   True
   >>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
   True

   >>> attr.asdict(sc)
   {'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

   >>> SomeClass()
   SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

   >>> C = attr.make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
   >>> C("foo", "bar")
   C(a='foo', b='bar')


After *declaring* your attributes ``attrs`` gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,
- a complete set of comparison methods (equality and ordering),
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

On Python 3.6 and later, you can often even drop the calls to ``attr.ib()`` by using `type annotations <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/types.html>`_.

This gives you the power to use actual classes with actual types in your code instead of confusing ``tuple``\ s or `confusingly behaving <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#namedtuples>`_ ``namedtuple``\ s.
Which in turn encourages you to write *small classes* that do `one thing well <https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries>`_.
Never again violate the `single responsibility principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle>`_ just because implementing ``__init__`` et al is a painful drag.

Release Information
===================

20.2.0 (2020-09-05)
-------------------

Backward-incompatible Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``attr.define()``, ``attr.frozen()``, ``attr.mutable()``, and ``attr.field()`` remain **provisional**.

  This release fixes a bunch of bugs and ergonomics but they remain mostly unchanged.

  If you wish to use them together with mypy, you can simply drop `this plugin <https://gist.github.com/hynek/1e3844d0c99e479e716169034b5fa963#file-attrs_ng_plugin-py>`_ into your project.

  Feel free to provide feedback to them in the linked issue #668.

  We will release the ``attrs`` namespace once we have the feeling that the APIs have properly settled.
  `#668 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/668>`_


Changes
^^^^^^^

- ``attr.define()`` et al now correct detect ``__eq__`` and ``__ne__``.
  `#671 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/671>`_
- ``attr.define()`` et al's hybrid behavior now also works correctly when arguments are passed.
  `#675 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/675>`_
- It's possible to define custom ``__setattr__`` methods on slotted classes again.
  `#681 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/681>`_
- In 20.1.0 we introduced the ``inherited`` attribute on the ``attr.Attribute`` class to differentiate attributes that have been inherited and those that have been defined directly on the class.

  It has shown to be problematic to involve that attribute when comparing instances of ``attr.Attribute`` though, because when sub-classing, attributes from base classes are suddenly not equal to themselves in a super class.

  Therefore the ``inherited`` attribute will now be ignored when hashing and comparing instances of ``attr.Attribute``.
  `#684 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/684>`_
- ``zope.interface`` is now a "soft dependency" when running the test suite; if ``zope.interface`` is not installed when running the test suite, the interface-related tests will be automatically skipped.
  `#685 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/685>`_
- The ergonomics of creating frozen classes using ``@define(frozen=True)`` and sub-classing frozen classes has been improved:
  you don't have to set ``on_setattr=None`` anymore.
  `#687 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/687>`_

=======

``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `subclassing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
