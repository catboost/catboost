``attrs`` is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka `dunder methods <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-dunder-methods>`_).
`Trusted by NASA <https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-badge>`_ for Mars missions since 2020!

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.

.. teaser-end

For that, it gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

.. -code-begin-

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from attrs import asdict, define, make_class, Factory

   >>> @define
   ... class SomeClass:
   ...     a_number: int = 42
   ...     list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)
   ...
   ...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
   ...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


   >>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   >>> sc
   SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

   >>> sc.hard_math(3)
   19
   >>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   True
   >>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
   True

   >>> asdict(sc)
   {'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

   >>> SomeClass()
   SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

   >>> C = make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
   >>> C("foo", "bar")
   C(a='foo', b='bar')


After *declaring* your attributes ``attrs`` gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,
- a equality-checking methods,
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

**Hate type annotations**!?
No problem!
Types are entirely **optional** with ``attrs``.
Simply assign ``attrs.field()`` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types.

----

This example uses ``attrs``'s `modern APIs <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#next-generation-apis>`_ that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the ``attrs`` package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.
The classic APIs (``@attr.s``, ``attr.ib``, plus their serious business aliases) and the ``attr`` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.

Please check out `On The Core API Names <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html>`_ for a more in-depth explanation.


Data Classes
============

On the tin, ``attrs`` might remind you of ``dataclasses`` (and indeed, ``dataclasses`` are a descendant of ``attrs``).
In practice it does a lot more more and is more flexible.
For instance it allows you to define `special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization>`_, or allows more ways to `plug into the initialization process <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization>`_.

For more details, please refer to our `comparison page <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes>`_.

Answering questions of your fellow developers is also a great way to help the project!

Release Information
===================

21.3.0 (2021-12-28)
-------------------

Backward-incompatible Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When using ``@define``, converters are now run by default when setting an attribute on an instance -- additionally to validators.
  I.e. the new default is ``on_setattr=[attrs.setters.convert, attrs.setters.validate]``.

  This is unfortunately a breaking change, but it was an oversight, impossible to raise a ``DeprecationWarning`` about, and it's better to fix it now while the APIs are very fresh with few users.
  `#835 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/835>`_,
  `#886 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/886>`_
- ``import attrs`` has finally landed!
  As of this release, you can finally import ``attrs`` using its proper name.

  Not all names from the ``attr`` namespace have been transferred; most notably ``attr.s`` and ``attr.ib`` are missing.
  See ``attrs.define`` and ``attrs.field`` if you haven't seen our next-generation APIs yet.
  A more elaborate explanation can be found `On The Core API Names <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html>`_

  This feature is at least for one release **provisional**.
  We don't *plan* on changing anything, but such a big change is unlikely to go perfectly on the first strike.

  The API docs have been mostly updated, but it will be an ongoing effort to change everything to the new APIs.
  Please note that we have **not** moved -- or even removed -- anything from ``attr``!

  Please do report any bugs or documentation inconsistencies!
  `#887 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/887>`_


Changes
^^^^^^^

- ``attr.asdict(retain_collection_types=False)`` (default) dumps collection-esque keys as tuples.
  `#646 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/646>`_,
  `#888 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/888>`_
- ``__match_args__`` are now generated to support Python 3.10's
  `Structural Pattern Matching <https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html#pep-634-structural-pattern-matching>`_.
  This can be controlled by the ``match_args`` argument to the class decorators on Python 3.10 and later.
  On older versions, it is never added and the argument is ignored.
  `#815 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/815>`_
- If the class-level *on_setattr* is set to ``attrs.setters.validate`` (default in ``@define`` and ``@mutable``) but no field defines a validator, pretend that it's not set.
  `#817 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/817>`_
- The generated ``__repr__`` is significantly faster on Pythons with f-strings.
  `#819 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/819>`_
- Attributes transformed via ``field_transformer`` are wrapped with ``AttrsClass`` again.
  `#824 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/824>`_
- Generated source code is now cached more efficiently for identical classes.
  `#828 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/828>`_
- Added ``attrs.converters.to_bool()``.
  `#830 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/830>`_
- ``attrs.resolve_types()`` now resolves types of subclasses after the parents are resolved.
  `#842 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/842>`_
  `#843 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/843>`_
- Added new validators: ``lt(val)`` (< val), ``le(va)`` (≤ val), ``ge(val)`` (≥ val), ``gt(val)`` (> val), and ``maxlen(n)``.
  `#845 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/845>`_
- ``attrs`` classes are now fully compatible with `cloudpickle <https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle>`_ (no need to disable ``repr`` anymore).
  `#857 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/857>`_
- Added new context manager ``attrs.validators.disabled()`` and functions ``attrs.validators.(set|get)_disabled()``.
  They deprecate ``attrs.(set|get)_run_validators()``.
  All functions are interoperable and modify the same internal state.
  They are not – and never were – thread-safe, though.
  `#859 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/859>`_
- ``attrs.validators.matches_re()`` now accepts pre-compiled regular expressions in addition to pattern strings.
  `#877 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/877>`_

Credits
=======

``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `subclassing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
