Routines for performing shortest-path graph searches

The main interface is in the function `graph_shortest_path`.  This
calls cython routines that compute the shortest path using either
the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, or Dykstra's algorithm with Fibonacci Heaps.

    Perform a shortest-path graph search on a positive directed or
    undirected graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist_matrix : arraylike or sparse matrix, shape = (N,N)
        Array of positive distances.
        If vertex i is connected to vertex j, then dist_matrix[i,j] gives
        the distance between the vertices.
        If vertex i is not connected to vertex j, then dist_matrix[i,j] = 0
    directed : boolean
        if True, then find the shortest path on a directed graph: only
        progress from a point to its neighbors, not the other way around.
        if False, then find the shortest path on an undirected graph: the
        algorithm can progress from a point to its neighbors and vice versa.
    method : string ['auto'|'FW'|'D']
        method to use.  Options are
        'auto' : attempt to choose the best method for the current problem
        'FW' : Floyd-Warshall algorithm.  O[N^3]
        'D' : Dijkstra's algorithm with Fibonacci stacks.  O[(k+log(N))N^2]

    Returns
    -------
    G : np.ndarray, float, shape = [N,N]
        G[i,j] gives the shortest distance from point i to point j
        along the graph.

    Notes
    -----
    As currently implemented, Dijkstra's algorithm does not work for
    graphs with direction-dependent distances when directed == False.
    i.e., if dist_matrix[i,j] and dist_matrix[j,i] are not equal and
    both are nonzero, method='D' will not necessarily yield the correct
    result.

    Also, these routines have not been tested for graphs with negative
    distances.  Negative distances can lead to infinite cycles that must
    be handled by specialized algorithms.
