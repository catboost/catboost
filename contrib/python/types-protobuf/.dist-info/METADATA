## Typing stubs for protobuf

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`protobuf`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`protobuf`.

This version of `types-protobuf` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `protobuf==4.24.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/protobuf. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Generated using [mypy-protobuf==3.5.0](https://github.com/nipunn1313/mypy-protobuf/tree/v3.5.0) on protobuf==4.21.8

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `5e4483618a02b4bf182940e3b89e8178855e6f32` and was tested
with mypy 1.8.0, pyright 1.1.350, and
pytype 2024.2.27.
