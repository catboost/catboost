Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors. Its
historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as well.
Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a deeper level
than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.

Jedi has support for two different goto functions. It's possible to search for
related names and to list all names in a Python file and infer them. Jedi
understands docstrings and you can use Jedi autocompletion in your REPL as
well.

Jedi uses a very simple API to connect with IDEs. There's a reference
implementation as a `VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_,
which uses Jedi's autocompletion.  We encourage you to use Jedi in your IDEs.
It's really easy.

Jedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects:

- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_, deoplete-jedi_, completor.vim_)
- Emacs (Jedi.el_, company-mode_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)
- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])
- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)
- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though. [`proof
  <https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?rev=KDE%2F4.13>`_]
- Atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)
- `GNOME Builder`_ (with support for GObject Introspection)
- `Visual Studio Code`_ (via `Python Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_)
- Gedit (gedi_)
- wdb_ - Web Debugger
- `Eric IDE`_ (Available as a plugin)
- `IPython 6.0.0+ <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html>`_

and many more!

There is also support for goto and renaming.

Get the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_
(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).

Docs are available at `https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. Pull requests with documentation
enhancements and/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. Jedi uses `semantic
versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

thread <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1063>`_.:



Installation
============

    pip install jedi

Note: This just installs the Jedi library, not the editor plugins. For
information about how to make it work with your editor, refer to the
corresponding documentation.

You don't want to use ``pip``? Please refer to the `manual
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.


Feature Support and Caveats
===========================

Jedi really understands your Python code. For a comprehensive list what Jedi
understands, see: `Features
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_. A list of
caveats can be found on the same page.

You can run Jedi on CPython 2.7 or 3.4+ but it should also
understand/parse code older than those versions. Additionally you should be able
to use `Virtualenvs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html#environments>`_
very well.

Tips on how to use Jedi efficiently can be found `here
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html#recipes>`_.

API
---

You can find the documentation for the `API here <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html>`_.


Autocompletion / Goto / Pydoc
-----------------------------

Please check the API for a good explanation. There are the following commands:

- ``jedi.Script.goto_assignments``
- ``jedi.Script.completions``
- ``jedi.Script.usages``

The returned objects are very powerful and really all you might need.


Autocompletion in your REPL (IPython, etc.)
-------------------------------------------

Starting with IPython `6.0.0` Jedi is a dependency of IPython. Autocompletion
in IPython is therefore possible without additional configuration.

It's possible to have Jedi autocompletion in REPL modes - `example video <https://vimeo.com/122332037>`_.
This means that in Python you can enable tab completion in a `REPL
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/usage.html#tab-completion-in-the-python-shell>`_.


Static Analysis / Linter
------------------------

To do all forms of static analysis, please try to use ``jedi.names``. It will
return a list of names that you can use to infer types and so on.

Linting is another thing that is going to be part of Jedi. For now you can try
an alpha version ``python -m jedi linter``. The API might change though and
it's still buggy. It's Jedi's goal to be smarter than classic linter and
understand ``AttributeError`` and other code issues.


Refactoring
-----------

Jedi's parser would support refactoring, but there's no API to use it right
now.  If you're interested in helping out here, let me know. With the latest
parser changes, it should be very easy to actually make it work.


Development
===========

There's a pretty good and extensive `development documentation
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html>`_.


Testing
=======

The test suite depends on ``tox`` and ``pytest``::

    pip install tox pytest

To run the tests for all supported Python versions::

    tox

If you want to test only a specific Python version (e.g. Python 2.7), it's as
easy as ::

    tox -e py27

Tests are also run automatically on `Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/davidhalter/jedi/>`_.

For more detailed information visit the `testing documentation
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/testing.html>`_.

.. :changelog:

Changelog
---------

0.13.3 (2019-02-24)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed an issue with embedded Pytho, see https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/issues/870

0.13.2 (2018-12-15)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed a bug that led to Jedi spawning a lot of subprocesses.

0.13.1 (2018-10-02)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Bugfixes, because tensorflow completions were still slow.

0.13.0 (2018-10-02)
+++++++++++++++++++

- A small release. Some bug fixes.
- Remove Python 3.3 support. Python 3.3 support has been dropped by the Python
  foundation.
- Default environments are now using the same Python version as the Python
  process. In 0.12.x, we used to load the latest Python version on the system.
- Added ``include_builtins`` as a parameter to usages.
- ``goto_assignments`` has a new ``follow_builtin_imports`` parameter that
  changes the previous behavior slightly.

0.12.1 (2018-06-30)
+++++++++++++++++++

- This release forces you to upgrade parso. If you don't, nothing will work
  anymore. Otherwise changes should be limited to bug fixes. Unfortunately Jedi
  still uses a few internals of parso that make it hard to keep compatibility
  over multiple releases. Parso >=0.3.0 is going to be needed.

0.12.0 (2018-04-15)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Virtualenv/Environment support
- F-String Completion/Goto Support
- Cannot crash with segfaults anymore
- Cleaned up import logic
- Understand async/await and autocomplete it (including async generators)
- Better namespace completions
- Passing tests for Windows (including CI for Windows)
- Remove Python 2.6 support

0.11.1 (2017-12-14)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Parso update - the caching layer was broken
- Better usages - a lot of internal code was ripped out and improved.

0.11.0 (2017-09-20)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Split Jedi's parser into a separate project called ``parso``.
- Avoiding side effects in REPL completion.
- Numpy docstring support should be much better.
- Moved the `settings.*recursion*` away, they are no longer usable.

0.10.2 (2017-04-05)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Python Packaging sucks. Some files were not included in 0.10.1.

0.10.1 (2017-04-05)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed a few very annoying bugs.
- Prepared the parser to be factored out of Jedi.

0.10.0 (2017-02-03)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Actual semantic completions for the complete Python syntax.
- Basic type inference for ``yield from`` PEP 380.
- PEP 484 support (most of the important features of it). Thanks Claude! (@reinhrst)
- Added ``get_line_code`` to ``Definition`` and ``Completion`` objects.
- Completely rewritten the type inference engine.
- A new and better parser for (fast) parsing diffs of Python code.

0.9.0 (2015-04-10)
++++++++++++++++++

- The import logic has been rewritten to look more like Python's. There is now
  an ``Evaluator.modules`` import cache, which resembles ``sys.modules``.
- Integrated the parser of 2to3. This will make refactoring possible. It will
  also be possible to check for error messages (like compiling an AST would give)
  in the future.
- With the new parser, the evaluation also completely changed. It's now simpler
  and more readable.
- Completely rewritten REPL completion.
- Added ``jedi.names``, a command to do static analysis. Thanks to that
  sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!
- Alpha version of the linter.


0.8.1 (2014-07-23)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that improve
  autocompletion for builtin libraries. Fixed.

0.8.0 (2014-05-05)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Memory Consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) has been reduced
  drastically. Loading times are down as well (it takes basically as long as an
  import).
- REPL completion is starting to become usable.
- Various small API changes. Generally this release focuses on stability and
  refactoring of internal APIs.
- Introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating correct Array
  indices and ``__getattr__`` strings possible.

0.7.0 (2013-08-09)
++++++++++++++++++

- Switched from LGPL to MIT license.
- Added an Interpreter class to the API to make autocompletion in REPL
  possible.
- Added autocompletion support for namespace packages.
- Add sith.py, a new random testing method.

0.6.0 (2013-05-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- Much faster parser with builtin part caching.
- A test suite, thanks @tkf.

0.5 versions (2012)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Initial development.
