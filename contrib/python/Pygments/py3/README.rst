Welcome to Pygments
===================

This is the source of Pygments.  It is a **generic syntax highlighter** written
in Python that supports over 500 languages and text formats, for use in code
hosting, forums, wikis or other applications that need to prettify source code.

Installing
----------

... works as usual, use ``pip install Pygments`` to get published versions,
or ``python setup.py install`` to install from a checkout.

Documentation
-------------

... can be found online at https://pygments.org/ or created with Sphinx by ::

   make docs

By default, the documentation does not include the demo page, as it requires
having Docker installed for building Pyodide. To build the documentation with
the demo page, use ::

   WEBSITE_BUILD=1 make docs

The initial build might take some time, but subsequent ones should be instant
because of Docker caching.

To view the generated documentation, serve it using Python's ``http.server``
module (this step is required for the demo to work) ::

   python3 -m http.server --directory doc/_build/html


Development
-----------

... takes place on `GitHub <https://github.com/pygments/pygments>`_, where the
Git repository, tickets and pull requests can be viewed.

Continuous testing runs on GitHub workflows:
