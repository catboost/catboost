#
# The PDF and PMF codes in this directory are parsed by a perl script
# to be used for a code generator. To make this parser as simple as 
# possible the following coding rules must be satisfied:
#
#  (1) The PDF subroutine must end with the sequence that matches the 
#      regular expression:
#         /\\/\\*\\s+end\\s+of\\s+$PDF_name/
#      where $PDF_name is the name of the PDF function.
#      E.g.: if the PDF function is _unur_pdf_gamma we must have
#
#      double _unur_pdf_gamma( double x, const UNUR_DISTR *distr )
#      { 
#         .... 
#      } /* end of _unur_pdf_gamma() */
#
#  (2) The first argument must be named `x' for PDFs and `k' for PMFs.
#
#  (3) Only use single commands for `if' blocks; do not use braces.
#
#  (4) `if' statements must be on a separate line; the `if' command
#      must be on the next line (comment lines and empty lines are
#      allowed).
#
#  (5) Do not use ?: statements. 
#
#
# Remark: 
# These rules need not be satisfied any other routine (e.g. dPDF, CDF, ...).
