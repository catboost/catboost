`olefile <https://www.decalage.info/olefile>`__ is a Python package to
parse, read and write `Microsoft OLE2
files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format>`__
(also called Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format or Compound
Document File Format), such as Microsoft Office 97-2003 documents,
vbaProject.bin in MS Office 2007+ files, Image Composer and FlashPix
files, Outlook messages, StickyNotes, several Microscopy file formats,
McAfee antivirus quarantine files, etc.

Download/Install
----------------

If you have pip or setuptools installed (pip is included in Python
2.7.9+), you may simply run **pip install olefile** or **easy_install
olefile** for the first installation.

To update olefile, run **pip install -U olefile**.

Otherwise, see http://olefile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install.html

Features
--------

-  Parse, read and write any OLE file such as Microsoft Office 97-2003
   legacy document formats (Word .doc, Excel .xls, PowerPoint .ppt,
   Visio .vsd, Project .mpp), Image Composer and FlashPix files, Outlook
   messages, StickyNotes, Zeiss AxioVision ZVI files, Olympus FluoView
   OIB files, etc
-  List all the streams and storages contained in an OLE file
-  Open streams as files
-  Parse and read property streams, containing metadata of the file
-  Portable, pure Python module, no dependency

olefile can be used as an independent package or with PIL/Pillow.

olefile is mostly meant for developers. If you are looking for tools to
analyze OLE files or to extract data (especially for security purposes
such as malware analysis and forensics), then please also check my
`python-oletools <https://www.decalage.info/python/oletools>`__, which
are built upon olefile and provide a higher-level interface.

Documentation
-------------

Please see the `online
documentation <http://olefile.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__ for more
information.

Real-life examples
