class Optimiser:
    """A fairly basic optimiser designed to increase the value of scores for
    targeted property-based testing.

    This implements a fairly naive hill climbing algorithm based on randomly
    regenerating parts of the test case to attempt to improve the result. It is
    not expected to produce amazing results, because it is designed to be run
    in a fairly small testing budget, so it prioritises finding easy wins and
    bailing out quickly if that doesn't work.

    testing." Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on
    Software Testing and Analysis. ACM, 2017.
