class Example:
    """Examples track the hierarchical structure of draws from the byte stream,
    within a single test run.

    Examples are created to mark regions of the byte stream that might be
    useful to the shrinker, such as:
    - The bytes used by a single draw from a strategy.
    - Useful groupings within a strategy, such as individual list elements.
    - Strategy-like helper functions that aren't first-class strategies.
    - Each lowest-level draw of bits or bytes from the byte stream.
    - A single top-level example that spans the entire input.

    Example-tracking allows the shrinker to try "high-level" transformations,
    such as rearranging or deleting the elements of a list, without having
    to understand their exact representation in the byte stream.

    Rather than store each ``Example`` as a rich object, it is actually
    just an index into the ``Examples`` class defined below. This has two
    purposes: Firstly, for most properties of examples we will never need
    to allocate storage at all, because most properties are not used on
    most examples. Secondly, by storing the properties as compact lists
    of integers, we save a considerable amount of space compared to
    Python's normal object size.

    This does have the downside that it increases the amount of allocation
    we do, and slows things down as a result, in some usage patterns because
    we repeatedly allocate the same Example or int objects, but it will
    often dramatically reduce our memory usage, so is worth it.
