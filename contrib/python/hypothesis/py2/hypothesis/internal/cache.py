    """Generic supertype for cache implementations.

    Defines a dict-like mapping with a maximum size, where as well as mapping
    to a value, each key also maps to a score. When a write would cause the
    dict to exceed its maximum size, it first evicts the existing key with
    the smallest score, then adds the new key to the map.

    A key has the following lifecycle:

    1. key is written for the first time, the key is given the score
       self.new_entry(key, value)
    2. whenever an existing key is read or written, self.on_access(key, value,
       score) is called. This returns a new score for the key.
    3. When a key is evicted, self.on_evict(key, value, score) is called.

    The cache will be in a valid state in all of these cases.

    Implementations are expected to implement new_entry and optionally
    on_access and on_evict to implement a specific scoring strategy.
