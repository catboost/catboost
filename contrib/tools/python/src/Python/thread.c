/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Per-thread data ("key") support.

Use PyThread_create_key() to create a new key.  This is typically shared
across threads.

Use PyThread_set_key_value(thekey, value) to associate void* value with
thekey in the current thread.  Each thread has a distinct mapping of thekey
to a void* value.  Caution:  if the current thread already has a mapping
for thekey, value is ignored.

Use PyThread_get_key_value(thekey) to retrieve the void* value associated
with thekey in the current thread.  This returns NULL if no value is
associated with thekey in the current thread.

Use PyThread_delete_key_value(thekey) to forget the current thread's associated
value for thekey.  PyThread_delete_key(thekey) forgets the values associated
with thekey across *all* threads.

While some of these functions have error-return values, none set any
Python exception.

None of the functions does memory management on behalf of the void* values.
You need to allocate and deallocate them yourself.  If the void* values
happen to be PyObject*, these functions don't do refcount operations on
them either.

The GIL does not need to be held when calling these functions; they supply
their own locking.  This isn't true of PyThread_create_key(), though (see
next paragraph).

There's a hidden assumption that PyThread_create_key() will be called before
any of the other functions are called.  There's also a hidden assumption
that calls to PyThread_create_key() are serialized externally.

 * If there is no mapping for key in the current thread, then:

 * around the "p->next = keyhead; keyhead = p" pair.  That allowed
 * another thread to mutate the list, via key deletion, concurrent with
 * find_key() crawling over the list.  Hilarity ensued.  For example, when
 * the for-loop here does "p = p->next", p could end up pointing at a
 * record that PyThread_delete_key_value() was concurrently free()'ing.
 * That could lead to anything, from failing to find a key that exists, to
