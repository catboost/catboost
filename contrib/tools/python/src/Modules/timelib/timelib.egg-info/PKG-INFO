        =====
        
        timelib is a short wrapper around php's internal timelib module.
        It currently only provides a few functions:
        
        timelib.strtodatetime:
        
        >>> timelib.strtodatetime('today')
        datetime.datetime(2009, 6, 23, 0, 0)
        >>> timelib.strtodatetime('today')
        datetime.datetime(2009, 6, 23, 0, 0)
        >>> timelib.strtodatetime('next friday')
        datetime.datetime(2009, 6, 26, 0, 0)
        >>> timelib.strtodatetime('29 feb 2008 -108 years')
        datetime.datetime(1900, 3, 1, 0, 0)
        
        timelib.strtotime:
        
        >>> import time, timelib
        >>> time.ctime(timelib.strtotime("now"))
        'Tue Jun 23 15:17:32 2009'
        >>> time.ctime(timelib.strtotime("4 hours ago"))
        'Tue Jun 23 11:17:38 2009'
        >>> time.ctime(timelib.strtotime("20080229 -1 year"))
        'Thu Mar  1 01:00:00 2007'
