Note: underlying algorithm `library/cpp/lcs` has complexity of O(r log n) by time and O(r) of additional memory, where r is the number of pairs (i, j) for which S1[i] = S2[j]. When comparing file with itself (or with little modifications) it becomes quadratic on the number of occurences of the most frequent line.
