# This file was generated by the YaTool build system (https://github.com/yandex/yatool),
# from a source YaTool build configuration provided in ya.make files.
#
# If the repository supports both CMake and ya build configurations, please modify both of them.
#
# If only CMake build configuration is supported then modify only CMake files and note that only
# simple modifications are allowed like adding source-files to targets or adding simple properties
# like target_include_directories. These modifications will be ported to original ya.make files
# by maintainers. Any complex modifications which can't be easily ported back to the ya build
# system may be rejected.
#
# Please refer to the build instructions in the repository for more information about manual
# changes in this file.

# Unfortunately, standard FindPython3 CMake module does not support Interpreter and NumPy COMPONENTS
# from different Python installations that prevents CI building for multiple Python versions and
# Cross-compilation, so we'll handle these special cases by setting ${Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIRS} explicitly
