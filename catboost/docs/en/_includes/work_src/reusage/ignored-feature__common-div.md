Feature indices or names to exclude from the training. It is assumed that all passed values are feature names if at least one of the passed values can not be converted to a number or a range of numbers. Otherwise, it is assumed that all passed values are feature indices.

Specifics:

- Non-negative indices that do not match any features are successfully ignored. For example, if five features are defined for the objects in the dataset and this parameter is set to <q>42</q>, the corresponding non-existing feature is successfully ignored.
    
- The identifier corresponds to the feature's index. Feature indices used in train and feature importance are numbered from 0 to `featureCount – 1`. If a file is used as [input data](../../../concepts/input-data.md) then any non-feature column types are ignored when calculating these indices. For example, each row in the input file contains data in the following order: `cat feature<\t>label value<\t>num feature`. So for the row `rock<\t>0<\t>42`, the identifier for the <q>rock</q> feature is 0, and for the <q>42</q> feature it's 1.
    

- The addition of a non-existing feature name raises an error.
