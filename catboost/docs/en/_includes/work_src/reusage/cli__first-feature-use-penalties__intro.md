Per-feature penalties for the first occurrence of the feature in the model. The given value is subtracted from the score if the current candidate is the first one to include the feature in the model.

Refer to the [Per-object and per-feature penalties](../../../concepts/algorithm-score-functions.md) section for details on applying different score penalties.

Non-negative float values are supported for each penalty.
