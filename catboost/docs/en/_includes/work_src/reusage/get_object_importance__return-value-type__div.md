Two lists of lists with indices and scores.

For example, if the input dataset contains 3 rows and the training dataset contains 4 rows, the indices list takes the following structure:

```
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 3, 4, 2]]
```

The scores list has the same structure with the corresponding scores instead of indices.
