Calculate the effect of objects from the training dataset on the optimized metric values for the objects from the validation dataset:
- Positive values reflect that the optimized metric increases.
- Negative values reflect that the optimized metric decreases.
The higher the deviation from 0, the bigger the impact that an object has on the optimized metric.

This mode is an implementation of the approach described in the [Finding Influential Training Samples for Gradient Boosted Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06640) paper .
