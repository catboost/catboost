The value of the feature interaction strength for each pair of features that are used in the model. Internally the model uses feature combinations as separate features. All feature combinations that are used in the model are listed separately. For example, if the model contains a feature named `F1` and a combination of features `{F2, F3}`, the interaction between `F1` and the combination of features `{F2, F3}` is listed in the output file.
