For each object:
- A list of features.
- The target or multiple targets for multiregression (optional).
- Other [types of data](../../../concepts/input-data_column-descfile.md).

Feature indices used in training and feature importance are numbered from 0 to `featureCount – 1`. Any non-feature column types are ignored when calculating these indices.
