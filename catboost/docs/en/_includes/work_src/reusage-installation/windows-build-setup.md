1. Clone the repository:

    ```no-highlight
    {{ installation--git-clone }}
    ```

1. (_Optionally_) Volta GPU users are advised to precisely set the required NVCC compile flags in the [default_nvcc_flags.make.inc](https://github.com/catboost/catboost/blob/master/catboost/cuda/cuda_lib/default_nvcc_flags.make.inc) configuration file. Removing irrelevant flags speeds up the compilation.

    {% note info %}

    {{ product }} may work incorrectly with Independent Thread Scheduling introduced in Volta GPUs when the number of splits for features exceeds 32.

    {% endnote %}

1. (_Optionally_) CUDA with compute capability 2.0 users must remove all lines starting with `-gencode` from the [default_nvcc_flags.make.inc](https://github.com/catboost/catboost/blob/master/catboost/cuda/cuda_lib/default_nvcc_flags.make.inc) configuration file and add the following line instead:
    ```no-highlight
    -gencode arch=compute_20,code=compute_20
    ```

1. {% if audience == "internal" %} {% include [arcadia_users_step](../../../yandex_specific/_includes/arcadia_users_step.md) %} {% endif %} Install [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019).

    - Choose the **Windows Platform development** and **Desktop Development with C++** options in the **workloads** tab.
    - Choose a suitable version of the MSVC compiler. It is advised to install VC++ 2019 version 16.11.11 v14.28 and CUDA Toolkit 11.0 or newer.

    {% note info %}

    Visual Studio forcibly installs the latest version of the compiler upon each update. The latest MSVC compiler may not be suitable for compiling {{ product }}, especially with CUDA.

    {% cut "Identify the set version of the compiler" %}


    1. Open the properties window for any `cpp` file of the project.
    1. Ensure the absence of the `/nologo` option in the compiler's command-line (for example, by adding the deprecated `/nologo-` option in the **Command Line/Additional Options** box).
    1. Compile this source file (**Ctrl** + **F7**).

    The set version of the compiler is printed to the **Output window**. {{ product }} can not be compiled with 19.14.* versions.

    {% endcut %}

    {% cut "Change the version of the compiler" %}

    Use one of the following methods to set the recommended version of the compiler:
    - Enable the required version as described in the [Visual C++ Team Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/side-by-side-minor-version-msvc-toolsets-in-visual-studio-2019/).

    - Run the environment setter from the command line with theÂ `vcvars_ver` option (the path to the script depends on the installation settings):

    ```bash
    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" -vcvars_ver=14.28
    ```

    Then open the solution:
    ```no-highlight
    start msvs\arcadia.sln
    ```
    {% endcut %}

    {% endnote %}
