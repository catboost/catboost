Alternatively, on Windows you could also use Visual Studio generators for CMake.
- For builds with CUDA use `Visual Studio 16 2019` generator and also specify the required toolset version when calling CMake by adding `-T version=14.28` to the command line.
- For builds without CUDA use `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator and also specify the required `ClangCL` toolset when calling CMake by adding `-T ClangCL` to the command line.
