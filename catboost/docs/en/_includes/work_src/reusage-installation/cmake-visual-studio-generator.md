Alternatively, on Windows you could also use Visual Studio generators for CMake.
- For builds with CUDA use `Visual Studio 16 2019` or `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator and also specify the required toolset version when calling CMake by adding `-T version=<toolset_version>` to the command line. The supported toolsets are listed [here](../../../installation/build-environment-setup-for-cmake.md#compilers,-linkers-and-related-tools).
- For builds without CUDA use `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator and also specify the required `ClangCL` toolset when calling CMake by adding `-T ClangCL` to the command line.
