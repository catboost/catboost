The model prediction results will be correct only if the features data in the input dataset contains all the features used in the model. Typically, the order of these features must match the order of the corresponding columns that is provided during the training. But if feature names are provided both during the training and in the third column of the feature descriptions in the [columns description](../../../concepts/input-data_column-descfile.md) file (specified with the `--column-description`/`--cd` parameter), they can be matched by names instead of the columns order.
