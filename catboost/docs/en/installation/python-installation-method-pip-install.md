# pip install

To install {{ product }} from pip:

1. Run the following command:

    ```no-highlight
    pip install catboost
    ```

    {% note info %}

    [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) contains precompiled wheels for most commonly used platform configurations:

    |Operating system|CPU architectures|GPU support using [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone)|
    |--------|-----------------|------------|
    | macOS (versions currently supported by Apple) | x86_64 and arm64 |no|
    | Linux (compatible with [manylinux2014 platform tag](https://peps.python.org/pep-0599/) ) | x86_64 and aarch64 |yes|
    | Windows 10 and 11 | x86_64 |yes|

    If the platform where the installation is performed is incompatible with platform tags of the available precompiled wheels then `pip` will try to build {{ product }} python package from source. This approach requires certain [build dependencies and requirements](python-installation-method-build-from-source.md#dependencies-and-requirements) to be set up before the installation.
