### CMake-based build tests

- C/C++ libraries.

  C/C++ libraries contain tests for them in `ut` subdirectories in the source tree. For library in `x/y/z` the corresponding test code will be in `x/y/z/ut` and the target name will be `x-y-z-ut`.
  So, in order to run the test [run CMake](build-from-source.md#build-cmake) and then build the corresponding `x-y-z-ut` target. Building this target will produce an executable `${CMAKE_BUILD_DIR}/x/y/z/x-y-z-ut`. Run this executable to execute all the tests.

- {{ r-package }}

    1. Install additional R packages that are required to run tests:
        - `caret`
        - `dplyr`
        - `jsonlite`
        - `testthat`

    1. Open the `R-package` directory from the local copy of the {{ product }} repository.

    1. Run the following command:

        ```
        R CMD check .
        ```


    To run tests using the devtools package:

    1. Install [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).
    1. Run the following command from the R session:

        ```
        devtools::test()
        ```

- CLI

  1. Install [testpath](https://pypi.org/project/testpath/), [pytest](https://pytest.org/), [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [catboost](https://pypi.org/project/catboost/) (used for reading column description files using `catboost.utils.read_cd`) packages for the python interpreter you intend to use.
  1. [Build](build-from-source#build-cmake) the CLI binary (target `catboost` for Ninja or another build tool) and a supplementary tool that is used to compare results generated as tests output with the canonical ones (target `limited_precision_dsv_diff` for Ninja or another build tool).
  1. Set the following environment variables:
      - `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` to the root of the local copy of the {{ product }} repository.
      - `CMAKE_BINARY_DIR` to the root for the build directory that has been generated by `CMake` and where the aformentioned targets have been built.
      - `TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` to the root for the directory where tests temporary data will be generated.
      - `HAVE_CUDA` - set to `1` if you want to run tests on GPU with `CUDA`, set to `0` otherwise.
  1. Open the `catboost/pytest` directory from the local copy of the {{ product }} repository.
  1. Run `python -m pytest`.

- Python package

  Tests will check `catboost` module for the `python` interpreter you run them with, so if you want to test `catboost` python package built from source [build and install it first](../installation/python-installation-method-build-from-source#installation).

  1. Install [testpath](https://pypi.org/project/testpath/), [pytest](https://pytest.org/), [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), [ipywidgets](https://pypi.org/project/ipywidgets/) and [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) packages for the python interpreter you intend to use.
  1. [Build](build-from-source#build-cmake) supplementary tools that are used to compare results generated as tests output with the canonical ones (targets `limited_precision_dsv_diff`, `limited_precision_json_diff`, `model_comparator` for Ninja or another build tool).
  1. Set the following environment variables:
      - `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` to the root of the local copy of the {{ product }} repository.
      - `CMAKE_BINARY_DIR` to the root for the build directory that has been generated by `CMake` and where the aformentioned targets have been built.
      - `TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` to the root for the directory where tests temporary data will be generated.
  1. Open the `catboost/python-package/ut/medium` directory from the local copy of the {{ product }} repository.
  1. Run `python -m pytest`.

  {% note warning %}

  Tests on GPU with `CUDA` will be run if and only if GPU with CUDA drivers installed is present.

  {% endnote %}

- JVM applier

    Open the `catboost/jvm-packages/catboost4j-prediction` directory from the local copy of the {{ product }} repository. Run standard `mvn test` command.
    To run tests on GPU as well add `-DtestOnGPU=1` command line flag.

- CatBoost for Apache Spark

    See [building CatBoost for Apache Spark from source](../installation/spark-installation-build-from-source-maven.md). Use standard `mvn test` command.

### YaMake-based build tests

{% note warning %}

The following documentation describes running tests using Ya Make which is applicable only for versions prior to [this commit](https://github.com/catboost/catboost/commit/c5c642ca0b8e093336d0229ac4b14c78db3915bb).

{% endnote %}

{{ product }} provides tests that check the compliance of the canonical data with the resulting data.

The required steps for running these tests depend on the implementation.
