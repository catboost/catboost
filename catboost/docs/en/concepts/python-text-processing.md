# Text processing

Text Processing is used to solve different tasks, including but not limited to:
- Use text data by machine learning algorithms.

    Raw texts can not be handled by machine learning algorithms and therefore must be preprocessed.

- Improve the quality of resulting models.

    The usage of different types of text preprocessing (i.e., excluding numbers from the text or replacing upper case words with lower-case ones) can lead to significant improvements in the quality of the resulting model.
