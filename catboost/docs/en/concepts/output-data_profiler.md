# Profiler information

#### {{ output--contains }}

Detailed information about the duration of different operations within each iteration of training.

#### {{ output--format }}

- The resulting file consists of blocks of information regarding a certain iteration and the average times of execution of different operations.
- The block of information regarding a certain iteration starts from a number representing a zero-based index of this iteration.
- Each of the following lines in the iteration block with the exception of the last line contains information regarding a single operation in the format:
    ```
    <verbal description operation>: <time> <sec|ms>
    ```
    
- The last line in the iteration block starts with a tab and contains tab-separated values of the time that has passed since training started and the remaining time until the end of training.
- The last block in the file contains information regarding the average times of execution of different operations and starts with the `Average times:` string on a new line.
- Each of the following lines in the block with average times of execution contains information regarding a single operation in the format:
    ```
    <verbal description operation>: <time> <sec|ms>
    ```
