Note that there are additionalÂ [system requirements](#gpu-system-requirements) and [specifics](#gpu-peculiarities) if training on GPU is required.


## GPU system requirements {#gpu-system-requirements}

{% include [reusage-installation-cli__gpu-support-from-the-box__p](../_includes/work_src/reusage-installation/cli__gpu-support-from-the-box__p.md) %}

{% include [installation-compute-capability-requirements](../_includes/work_src/reusage-code-examples/compute-capability-requirements.md) %}

{% include [installation-nvidia-driver-reqs](../_includes/work_src/reusage-code-examples/nvidia-driver-reqs.md) %}

## GPU specifics {#gpu-peculiarities}

- Some training parameters are missing but will be added in future releases
- Multiple train runs with the same random seed may result in different formulas because of the float summation order
