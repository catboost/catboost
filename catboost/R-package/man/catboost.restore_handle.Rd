\title{Restore or complete model handle after de-serializing}
\usage{
catboost.restore_handle(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The model obtained as the result of training which has been serialized and is
now de-serialized.}
}
\value{
The model object with its handle pointing to a valid object in memory.
}
\description{
After de-serializing a model object through R base's functions (`readRDS`, `load`),
             its underlying object will not exist in the computer's memory anymore, and needs
             to be restored from the raw bytes that the model stores.

             This is automatically done internally when calling functions such as \link{catboost.predict},
             but the process is repeated at each call, which makes them slower than if using a
             fresh model object and increases memory usage inbetween calls to the garbage collector.
             This function allows restoring the internal object beforehand so as to avoid
             restoring the object multiple times.
             
             Note that the model object needs to be re-assigned as the output of this function,
             as the modifications are not done in-place.
