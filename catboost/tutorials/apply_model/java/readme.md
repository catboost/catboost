# Apply CatBoost model from Java
This tutorial consists of two parts:
- first part where we preprocess dataset and train the classifier model.
  This part can be found in [train_model.ipynb](train_model.ipynb).
- second part where we load model into Java application and then apply it
  This part presented as a small Maven project. If you just want to look at code snippets you can
  go directly to [CatBoost4jPredictionTutorial.java](src/main/java/CatBoost4jPredictionTutorial.java).
