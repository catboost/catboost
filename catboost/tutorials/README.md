# CatBoost tutorials

## Basic

It's better to start CatBoost exploring from this basic tutorials.

### Python

* [Python Tutorial](python_tutorial.ipynb)
    * This tutorial shows some base cases of using CatBoost, such as model training, cross-validation and predicting, as well as some useful features like early stopping,  snapshot support, feature importances and parameters tuning.
* [Python Tutorial with task](python_tutorial_with_tasks.ipynb)
    * There are 17 questions in this tutorial. Try answering all of them, this will help you to learn how to use the library.

### R

* [R Tutorial](r_tutorial.ipynb)
    * This tutorial shows how to convert your data to CatBoost Pool, how to train a model and how to make cross validation and parameter tunning.

### Command line

* [Command Line Tutorial](cmdline_tutorial.md)
    * This tutorial shows how to train and apply model with the command line tool.

## Classification

* [Classification Tutorial](classification/classification_tutorial.ipynb)
    * Here is an example for CatBoost to solve binary classification and multi-classification problems.

## Ranking
* [Ranking Tutorial](ranking/ranking_tutorial.ipynb)
    * CatBoost is learning to rank on Microsoft dataset (msrank).

## Feature selection
* [Feature selection Tutorial](feature_selection/eval_tutorial.ipynb)
    * This tutorial shows how to make feature evaluation with CatBoost and explore learning rate.

## Model analysis

* [Object Importance Tutorial](model_analysis/object_importance_tutorial.ipynb)
    * This tutorial shows how to evaluate importances of the train objects for test objects. And with using of importance scores detect noisy train objects.

* [SHAP Values Tutorial](model_analysis/shap_values_tutorial.ipynb)
    * This tutorial shows how to use [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) python-package to get and visualize feature importances.

## Custom loss

* [Custom Metrics Tutorial](custom_loss/custom_metric_tutorial.md)
    * This tutorial shows how to add custom per-object metrics.

## Apply model

* [CatBoost CoreML Tutorial](apply_model/coreml_export_tutorial.ipynb)
    * Explore this tutorial to learn how to convert CatBoost model to CoreML format and use it on any iOS device.

* [Export CatBoost Model as C++ code Tutorial](apply_model/model_export_as_cpp_code_tutorial.md)
    * Catboost model could be saved as standalone C++ code.

* [Export CatBoost Model as Python code Tutorial](apply_model/model_export_as_python_code_tutorial.md)
    * Catboost model could be saved as standalone Python code.

* [Export CatBoost Model in JSON format Tutorial](apply_model/model_export_as_json_tutorial.ipynb)
    * Catboost model could be saved in JSON format and applied.

## Competition examples

* [Kaggle Paribas Competition Tutorial](competition_examples/kaggle_paribas.ipynb)
    * This tutorial shows how to get to a 9th place on Kaggle Paribas competition with only few lines of code and training a CatBoost model.

* [ML Boot Camp V Competition Tutorial](competition_examples/mlbootcamp_v_tutorial.ipynb)
    * This is an actual 7th place solution by Mikhail Pershin. Solution is very simple and is based on CatBoost.

* [CatBoost & TensorFlow Tutorial](competition_examples/quora_w2v.ipynb)
    * This tutorial shows how to use CatBoost together with TensorFlow on Kaggle Quora Question Pairs competition if you have text as input data.

## Events
