## Sprint 16 — Performance Diagnosis & First Cut

**Branch**: `mlx/sprint-16-perf-diagnosis`
**Goal**: Measure the MLX perf gap, restore state file hygiene, land the sync-storm free-move.

### Open

## Campaign Scoreboard — Operation Verstappen

**Sprint 24 exit targets** (all benchmarks report 32-bin and 128-bin columns):

### Primary dominance targets

- [ ] 10k regression: MLX ≤ 0.20s (1.35x faster than CPU)
- [ ] 50k regression: MLX ≤ 0.25s (1.68x faster than CPU)
- [ ] 50k binary: MLX ≤ 0.40s (1.85x faster than CPU)
- [ ] 50k multiclass: MLX ≤ 0.60s (2.2x faster than CPU)
- [ ] 500k regression: MLX ≤ 0.3x CPU
- [ ] 2M regression: MLX ≤ 0.2x CPU (5x faster)
- [ ] Beat XGBoost + LightGBM on every 50k+ benchmark
- [ ] Match or beat CatBoost CUDA A100 on Airline 10M (15s target, szilard/GBM-perf 2024)

### Secondary targets

- [ ] Histogram SIMD occupancy ≥ 70%
- [ ] Sync points per training iteration ≤ 2
- [ ] CI perf regression gate: no PR lands with >5% regression
- [ ] Correctness parity vs CPU reference: delta ≤ 1e-5

### Small-N policy

N < 5k: CPU fallback acceptable. Championship push focuses on N ≥ 10k.

## Sprint 17–24 Backlog (one-line each, expanded per sprint)

- Sprint 17: Histogram occupancy fix — `maxBlocksPerPart` tuning, kernel rewrite (4–8x expected at N≥100k)
- Sprint 18: Multiclass per-dim fusion — fuse approxDim loop into one histogram dispatch (2–4x multiclass)
- Sprint 19: Depth pipelining — eliminate per-depth CPU readbacks at structure_searcher.cpp:252,550
- Sprint 20: Quantization fastpath — GPU quantization on ingest, persistent device-resident datasets
- Sprint 21: Leaf + apply fusion — one command buffer for leaf estimation + tree apply
- Sprint 22: Kernel specialization — dtype/depth-specialized kernels via MLX JIT template system
- Sprint 23: Large-scale tiling — datasets exceeding Metal buffer limits, async CPU→GPU streaming
- Sprint 24: Championship benchmark — final tuning, dominance suite vs CPU + CUDA, release polish

## Carry-forward from pre-Sprint 16

- BUG-007: nanobind path doesn't sort group_ids (silent divergence on unsorted input) — from @qa-engineer Sprint 12 review
- bench_boosting K=10 anchor mismatch: expected 2.22267818, measured 1.78561831 — flagged Sprint 7, unresolved
